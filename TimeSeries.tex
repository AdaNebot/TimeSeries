\begin{abstract}
  This document describes a proposal to annotate in a VOTable time series data. It is limitted to the most common type of time series, i.e. tabular data containing a parameter measured as a function of time. The annotation reuses elements of exisiting Data Models when possible and defines a set of new elements. This document can be taken as a test case of the more general purpose model CADM.

The words ``MUST'', ``SHALL'', ``SHOULD'', ``MAY'', ``RECOMMENDED'', and

interpreted as described in IETF standard RFC2119 \citep{std:RFC2119}.

The \emph{Virtual Observatory (VO)} is a
general term for a collection of federated resources that can be used
to conduct astronomical research, education, and outreach.
The \href{http://www.ivoa.net}{International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)} is a global
collaboration of separately funded projects to develop standards and
infrastructure that enable VO applications.


\section{Introduction}
This document describes how data providers can publish time series of tabular data to the Virtual Observatory.
This document does not describe how data providers store or manipulate the data, it only concerns how the data are exposed to the world using well-defined metadata. 
This document assumes that the data provider already destributes time series as a single table, this table can contain several columns.
This document does not limit the number of columns the time series can contain to those explecitely mentioned here. It only suggest metadata to the most common columns in time series.

\section{The Time Series}
This document proposes the minimum metadata in VOTables to describe time series. We assume that the tabular data can contain multiple rows for each astronomical source and for mixed types of time series (e.~g. different filters) and sometimes different types of data (e.~g. spectra, or images)

We propose the following elements to describe the elements of the time series: 

\subsection{TIME}
\textbf{TIMESYS} contains information on the time scale, reference position and offset regarding the time of the observation \cite{VOTable1.4, TIMESYS}. A service providing time series \textbf{must} provide this element. 

\subsection{BAND}
\textbf{BAND} contains information on the filter of the observations. A service providing time series of the type light-curve (e.~g. magnitudes, fluxes) \textbf{may} provide this element.

\subsection{GROUP}
\textbf{GROUP} contains the time series data itself. Each GROUP will contain:
\begin{itemize}
     \item A DESCRIPTION element
     \item One or several FIELDref
     \item One or several PARAM or PARAMref
\end{itemize}

%\section{Architecture}
%We consider the general case of a service returning time series in the form of tabular data.
