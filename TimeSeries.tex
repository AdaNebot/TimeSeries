\begin{abstract}
  This document describes a proposal to annotate in a VOTable time series data. It is limitted to the most common type of time series, i.e. tabular data containing a parameter measured as a function of time. The annotation reuses elements of exisiting Data Models when possible and defines a set of new elements. This document can be taken as a test case of the more general purpose model CADM.

The words ``MUST'', ``SHALL'', ``SHOULD'', ``MAY'', ``RECOMMENDED'', and
``OPTIONAL'' (in upper or lower case) used in this document are to be
interpreted as described in IETF standard RFC2119 \citep{std:RFC2119}.

The \emph{Virtual Observatory (VO)} is a
general term for a collection of federated resources that can be used
to conduct astronomical research, education, and outreach.
The \href{http://www.ivoa.net}{International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)} is a global
collaboration of separately funded projects to develop standards and
infrastructure that enable VO applications.


\section{Introduction}
This document describes how data providers can publish time series of tabular data to the Virtual Observatory.
This document does not describe how data providers store or manipulate the data, it only concerns how the data are exposed to the world using well-defined metadata. 
This document assumes that the data provider already destributes time series as a single table, this table can contain several columns.
This document does not limit the number of columns the time series can contain to those explecitely mentioned here. It only suggest metadata to the most common columns in time series.

\section{The Time Series Structure}
\label{elem:TIMESERIES}
This document proposes the minimum metadata in VOTables to describe time series. We assume that the tabular data can contain multiple rows for each astronomical source and for mixed types of time series (e.~g. different filters) and sometimes different types of data (e.~g. spectra, or images)

We propose the following elements to describe the elements of the time series: 
\subsection{\elem{TIMESYS} Element}
\elem{TIMESYS} contains information on the time scale, reference position and offset regarding the time of the observation \cite{VOTable1.4, TIMESYS}. A service providing time series \textbf{must} provide this element. 

\subsection{\elem{FILTERSYS} Element}
\elem{FILTERSYS} contains information on the photometric system of the observations. Elements introduced here are inherited from the Photometry Data Model \cite{XX}. A service providing time series of the type light-curve (e.~g. magnitudes, fluxes) \textbf{MUST} provide this element. 
\begin{description}
     \item[\elem{ID}] This attribute is used to reference the \elem{FILTERSYS} elements from the elements using the photometric system. This attribute is mandatory.
     \item[\elem{uniqueIdentifier}] This is the field to uniquely identify the zero point assigned to a filter and to a specific photometric system. We recommend the syntax: Facility/Subcategory/Band/Photometric System Type[/Suffix]\todo{I am not sure about that suffix, I just copied from the PhotDM, but this needs to be checked, please Jesus, can you have a look at that? } (e.g. SDSS/SDSS.G/G/AB, GAIA/GAIA.G/G/AB). 
     \item[\elem{zeroPointFlux}] Photometric zero point associated to this instance. 
     \item[\elem{magnitudeSystem}] Magnitude system associated to this instance.
     \item[\elem{effectiveWavelength}] Effective wavelength of the filter in this instance. \todo{It could have been the mean wavelength too.}
\end{description}

\todo{Jesus: I would like to somehow encourage data providers to give their full info for services such as the SVO profile.}

\subsection{\elem{GROUP}}
\elem{GROUP} contains the time series data itself. A service providing time series \textbf{must} provide this element. 
Each \elem{GROUP} contains:
\begin{itemize}
     \item A DESCRIPTION element
     \item One or several FIELDref
     \item One or several PARAM or PARAMref. This will describe the BAND for instance. While PARAM is usually defining valid for a whole table in this case it will be valid only for the GROUP.  
     \item One SELECT element (when needed). This element provides a way to reference rows instead of columns. 
\end{itemize}

%\section{Architecture}
%We consider the general case of a service returning time series in the form of tabular data.
