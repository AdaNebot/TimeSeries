\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  This document describes a proposal to annotate in a VOTable time series data. It is limited to the most common type of time series in astronomy: light curves, but it can be extended to other type of time series data easily (e.~g. radial velocities and positions). The annotation reuses elements of existing Data Models when possible and defines a set of new elements. This document can be taken as a test case of a more general purpose model.

\section{Introduction}
This document describes how data providers can publish time series of tabular data to the Virtual Observatory. This document does not describe how data providers store or manipulate the data, it only concerns how the data are exposed to the world using well-defined metadata. This document assumes that the data provider already destributes time series as a single table, this table can contain several columns. This document does not limit the number of columns the time series can contain to those explecitely mentioned here. It only suggest metadata to the most common columns in time series.

\section{Science use cases for Time Series}
In this section we describe a number of science use cases the proposed annotation of time series in this document will enable. We devide this science cases in different groups, according to their common requirements. 
%What operations should clients be able to perform based on this without further user intervention?
\subsection{Case A: Light curves in same photometric band}
Common requirement: Combine photometry and light curves of a given object/list of objects in the same photometric band. 

\subsubsection{Use Case 1: Supernova classification using the light curve}
The visual light curves of the different supernova types vary in shape and amplitude, based on the underlying mechanisms of the explosion, the way that visible radiation is produced, and the transparency of the ejected material.
\subsubsection{Use Case 2: Long-term analysis of variable stars}
Long-term period and light curve variations, based on the historical data and new observations. The continuous period increase can be interpreted as a mass transfer from the secondary to the primary star. The most likely explanation of the sinusoidal variation found is a light-traveltime effect due to the existence of a circumbinary object which would make BX Dra a triple system.
\subsubsection{Use Case 3: Discovering brown dwarfs by analyzing binary microlensing events}
Microlensing events show characteristic light curve variations which can be used to determine the type of system producing it. %(based on Shin et al. 2012)

%\subsubsection{Use Case 4: Eclipsing binary systems - phase}
% Based on G\'omez Maqueo et al 2009)

\subsection{Case B: light curves in different photometric bands}
Common requirement: Combine photometry and light curves of a given object/list of objects in different photometric bands.

\subsubsection{Use Case 4: Follow-up characterisation of supernovae}
%based on Zhang et al. arXiv:1208.6078v1)
Light curves at different wavelength provide different information allowing a better understanding of the physical processes related to the supernovae explosion.

\section{The Time Series Structure}
\label{elem:TIMESERIES}
This document proposes the minimum metadata in VOTables to describe time series. We assume that the tabular data can contain multiple rows for each astronomical source and for mixed types of time series (e.~g. different filters, positions, radial velocities) and sometimes even include different types of data (e.~g. spectra, or images). 

We propose using some elements previously defined, such as \elem{TIMESYS} and \elem{COOSYS} (when applicable) in VOTable1.4 \cite{VOTable1.4} and define a set of new elements as well as how to structure these elements. The aim is to be able to combine multiple time series when they have common elements as described in this document. We define a \elem{GROUP} element called \elem{PHOTCAL} following the same type of structure. If these elements were to be added or modified in future versions of VOTable it should be straight forward to update this document. This note is inspired by a previous annotation strategy developed for annotating photometric data in VOTables \citep{note:seb2010-1}.

%\input{timesys.tex}
%\input{coosys.tex}

\subsection{\elem{PHOTCAL} Element}
\elem{PHOTCAL} contains information on the photometric system of the observations. This element is partially asociated to the intermediate class PhotCal of the Photometry Data Model \cite{PhotometryDM}. A service providing time series of the type light-curve (e.~g. magnitudes, fluxes) \textbf{MUST} provide this element. To reference the photometric system defined by a \elem{PHOTCAL} element, \elem{FIELD}s (and possibly \elem{PARAM}s) \textbf{MUST} reference the \elem{PHOTCAL} using the VOTable \attr{ref} attribute. A \elem{PHOTCAL} element referenced via a \attr{ref} attribute \textbf{SHOULD} appear before the element that references it. 

Each \elem{PHOTCAL} is defined as a \elem{GROUP} with the following mandatory terms:
\begin{description}
     \item[\attrval{name}{PHOTCAL}] The name of the \elem{GROUP} \textbf{MUST} be set to \verb|PHOTCAL|. We realize that although this proposed usage of the \attr{name} is not common, it is not forbidden by VOTable \cite[][see Section 3.2], and in this context it will help clients interpret the contents of the \elem{GROUP}. 
     \item[\attr{ID}] This attribute is used to reference the \elem{PHOTCAL} \elem{GROUP} from the elements using the photometric system. This attribute needs to be unique within the document so that it can be referenced by \elem{FIELD}s and is mandatory.
     \item[\attr{DESCRIPTION}] This attribute is used to describe the \elem{PHOTCAL} \elem{GROUP}. This attribute is optional, but recommended.
     \item[\attrval{utype}{timeseries:PhotometryPoint}]
\end{description}

The attributes of this \elem{GROUP} are defined as \elem{PARAM}s containing the following information: 
\begin{description}
\item[\elem{filterIdentifier}] This is the \elem{PARAM} element to uniquely identify the zero point assigned to a filter and to a specific photometric system. This element MUST have the following attributes:
\begin{description}
    \item[\attrval{name}{filterIdentifier}]
    \item[\attrval{ucd}{meta.id;instr.filter}]
    \item[\attrval{utype}{photDM:PhotometryFilter.identifier}]
    \item[\attrval{datatype}{char}]
    \item[\attrval{value}{value}] Value SHOULD follow the syntax: Facility/Subcategory/Band (e.~g. \attrval{value}{GAIA/GAIA.G/G}, \attrval{value}{Palomar/ZTF.r}). 
\end{description}
\item[\elem{zeroPointFlux}] Photometric zero point associated to this instance. This element MUST have the following attributes:
\begin{description}
    \item[\attrval{name}{zeroPointFlux}]
    \item[\attrval{ucd}{phot.mag;arith.zp}]
    \item[\attrval{utype}{photDM:PhotCal.zeroPoint.flux.value}]
    \item[\attrval{datatype}{datatype}]
    \item[\attrval{unit}{unit}]
    \item[\attrval{value}{value}]
\end{description}
\item[\elem{magnitudeSystem}] Magnitude system associated to this instance (Vega, AB, ...). This element MUST have the following attributes:
\begin{description}
    \item[\attrval{name}{magnitudeSystem}]
    \item[\attrval{ucd}{meta.code}] 
    \item[\attrval{utype}{photDM:PhotCal.magnitudeSystem.type}]
    \item[\attrval{datatype}{char}]
    \item[\attrval{unit}{unit}]
    \item[\attrval{value}{value}]
\end{description}
\item[\elem{effectiveWavelength}] Effective wavelength of the filter in this instance. This element MUST have the following attributes:
\begin{description}
    \item[\attrval{name}{effectiveWavelength}]
    \item[\attrval{ucd}{em.wl.effective}]
    \item[\attrval{utype}{photDM:PhotometryFilter.spectralLocation.value}] 
    \item[\attrval{datatype}{float}]
    \item[\attrval{unit}{unit}]
    \item[\attrval{value}{value}]
\end{description}
\end{description}

Proposed annotation example for a \elem{PHOTCAL} element: 
\input{photcal_PARAM.tex}


While following the same approach as for \elem{COOSYS} and \elem{TIMESYS} would result in a more compact annotation, we decide to define this element as a \elem{GROUP} to allow for some flexibility on the data provider side. We are aware that this implies clients to work around more complex annotations. We hope to alleviate that by following the exact \attr{name} and \attr{utype} convention as proposed in this document.

The alternative to doing this, and which would simplify the annotation, is to bring this \elem{GROUP} element closer to the \elem{COOSYS} and \elem{TIMESYS} elements by fixing the units of the \attr{zeroPointFlux} and the \attr{effectiveWavelength} to Jy and Angstrom respectively and add it to future versions of VOTable. This would look as follows: 

\input{photcal_FILTERSYS.tex}


%\input{VELSYS}

For other type of time series data not explicitly defined in this document we reccomend to use the appropriate UCD1+ in agreement with \url{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/UCD1+/index.html}. The data provider is responsible for providing accurate metadata for the elements here described.


%\input{GROUP.tex}
\subsection{\elem{TABLE}}
%\todo{We could propose to define one \elem{TABLE} element to describe the content of each timeseries with common metadata (e.~g. one per filter) with no \elem{DATA}, and to add in a separate \elem{TABLE} element the \elem{DATA} part wich will referece the approprate \elem{TABLE} element. But to be honest I am not sure about the pros and contras of that at the moment of writing.} 
We propose to use the \elem{TABLE} element for describing the contents of the time series data itself. One \elem{TABLE} element MUST be present for each \elem{PHOTCAL} \elem{GROUP} element defined. 
The \elem{TABLE} must include:
\begin{description}
     \item[\attr{DESCRIPTION}] Human readable text describing the time series. This element is mandatory. 
     \item[\elem{PARAM}] This element is mandatory and MUST have the following attributes:
     \begin{description}
        \item[\attrval{name}{dataproduct\_type}]
        \item[\attrval{ucd}{meta.code.class}]
        \item[\attrval{utype}{obscore:ObsDataset.dataProductType}] 
        \item[\attrval{datatype}{char}]
         \item[\attrval{arraysize}{"*"}]
       \item[\attrval{unit}{""}]
        \item[\attrval{value}{timeseries}] This attribute is mandatory and it MUST be set to \verb|timeseries|. 
     \end{description}
     \item[\elem{PARAM}] This element is optional and MUST have the following attributes:  
     \begin{description}
        \item[\attrval{name}{dataproduct\_subtype}]
        \item[\attrval{ucd}{meta.code.class}]
        \item[\attrval{utype}{obscore:ObsDataset.dataProductSubtype}] 
        \item[\attrval{datatype}{char}]
        \item[\attrval{arraysize}{"*"}]
        \item[\attrval{unit}{""}]
        \item[\attrval{value}{lightcurve}] (could be extended to radial velocity curve or other type of timeseries data. If extended we recommend defining and using a controlled vocabulary). 
     \end{description}
     \item One or several columns having the attribute \elem{ref} to reference to the \elem{TIMESYS} element. At least one such reference MUST be provided.
     \item One or several columns having the attribute \elem{ref} to reference to the \elem{COOSYS} (when applicable). 
     \item One or several columns having the attribute \elem{ref} to reference to each \elem{PHOTCAL} defined (when applicable). 
\end{description}

\input{table_TIMESERIES.tex}

We explored other ways of annotating the data, for instance defining different tables and the relation between them using foreignKey as possible according to Section 4.10 of VOTable1.4, or even proposing a new XMLDATA serialization. After exploring those possibilities we conclude that the proposed solution is the most appropriate within the actual and most accepted usage of VOTablefor both existing data providers and clients.

\section{Example of VOTable serialization}
\subsection{Case 1: lightcurves in one filter}
Let us consider the simplest time series case possible: a table containing only three columns:
\begin{center}
   \emph{time, magnitude, magnitude error}
\end{center}
the minimum VOTable would look like this:
\input{vot-ex1-GROUP.tex}

This annotation would also work in the case of tables including multiple light filters in the form
\begin{center}
   \emph{time\_1, magnitude\_1,magnitude\_error\_1, time\_2, magnitude\_2,magnitude\_error\_2}
\end{center}

\subsection{Case 2: lightcurves in multiple filters}
Let us consider now consider a more complicated case, in which the time series includes a column with name of the photometric filter of each row of the time series, i.~e. a table containing four columns:
\begin{center}
   \emph{time, magnitude, magnitude error, filter name}.
\end{center}
In those cases this complicates the annotation and the need of being able to reference rows (as well as columns) becomes an issue. It is to overcome such problem, that we propose to use different \elem{TABLE} elements for different types of products. We propose therefore to annotate a VOTable as shown in the following example: 

\begingroup
\input{vot-ex2-GROUP.tex}
\endgroup    

%To avoid referencing columns, which would make things a bit more complicated, we propose to create different \elem{TABLE} elements, one for each filter. This, although reduntant in the definition of some of the columns, will ease combining timeseries from the client side. 

%Alternative 2: Use the GROUP name=key thing and a different table to define the relation between elements. This 
%Alternative 3: Another possible solution would be to create a new XMLDATA serialization which would allow to tag rows, as proposed in Appendix A.8 of \cite{VOTable1.4}. But wouldn't that break the interoperability? 


\todo{Do we have to say something about claiming a new capability in the registry? }
\todo{Do we want to add a summary table with utype, UCD1+, Meaning, Default value, Data type, required?}
