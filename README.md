# Time Series

This document   This document describes a proposal to annotate in a VOTable time series data. It is limitted to the most common type of time series, i.e. tabular data containing a parameter measured as a function of time. The annotation reuses elements of exisiting Data Models when possible and defines a set of new elements. This document can be taken as a test case of the more general purpose model CADM. 

Keep in mind to use the --recurse-submodules option when cloning the repository.
